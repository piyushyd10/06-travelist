usePopcorn - Movie Management App

"usePopcorn" is a React.js application that provides users with an interactive way to manage their movie watchlists and ratings. This app allows users to search for movies, add them to a watchlist, rate them, and view detailed information, such as release date, actors, director, and IMDb ratings.
Features:

    Search Movies: Fetch movie data using the OMDb API with React's useEffect hook.
    Watchlist Management: Add movies to your watchlist and view the average IMDb rating, user rating, and duration.
    User Ratings: Rate movies and see your average rating across all rated movies. Once rated, a movie cannot be added again, and the app will notify you if a movie has already been rated.
    Remove Movies: Easily remove movies from your watchlist.
    Data Persistence: Uses React state management to store watchedMovies, movieList, etc.
